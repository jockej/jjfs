.SH NAME
jjfs \- Joakim Jalap's file system
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B jjfs
mountpoint
.BR
.B jjfs

.SH DESCRIPTION
Jjfs is a fuse filesystem meant for a specific use case. It is meant to mount a
remote filesystem over sftp (a but like sshfs(1)) but to minimize disk activity
on the remote system. Therefore a cache is kept on the local system and
consulted for stats. When reading of a file is requested this file is
transferred over sftp to a staging directory on the local machine and then read
from there.

.SH BUGS
Tis program surely leaks memory, but its memory use should be modest enough that
it doesn't really matter.
